MIDIboxSID V2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o created patch structure for Lead engine
   o removed old sound engine, the new one will be built up from scratch
   o overworked control surface handler - now we can control left and
     right SID channel separately (or together)
   o press and hold LINK button to select the SID channel (left/right) with GP button #1
   o this menu also allows to send a patch via SysEx
   o new patches can now also be received - this is important during
     development phase to store/restore sound patches via MIDI-Ox
   o Portamento effect implemented - "normal" and "constant time glide" CTG
     CTG can be selected in the OSC menu (PMd item)
   o A third portamento effect implemented: Glissando (PMd item: "Gls")
   o SusKey and Legato implemented (-> CFG menu)
   o LFO implemented - in addition to Sine/Triangle/Saw/Pulse/Random
     now also "Positive" Sine/Triangle/Saw/Pulse is available - they
     can be inverted with negative depth
   o menu items with toggle function now never go into "entry" mode
     where parameter has to be modified with datawheel - this is for
     faster usage
   o implemented modulation matrix:
     - there are 8 modulation paths
     - each path has two sources: ENV1..2, LFO1..LFO6, Constant 0-127 - much more will be added later
     - an operation parameter is available for each path:
       SRC1 only, SRC2 only, SRC1+SRC2, SRC1-SRC2, SRC1*SRC2, XOR, OR, AND, MIN, MAX, 1<2, 1>2, 1=2)
     - a depth parameter is available for each path
     - paths can be routed to Pitch Voice 1/2/3, Pulsewidth Voice 1/2/3,
       Filter and Volume of left/right SID separately
     - in addition they can be routed to 2 individual targets 
       LFO1-6 Rate, LFO1-6 Depth
       More (e.g. ENV parameters) will be added later
     - Target 1/Left Channel and Target 2/Right Channel subpath can
       be inverted for simple stereo effects
   o added pulsewidth as modulation target
   o ENV implemented - it provides the parameters 
     Attack1/ALevel/Attack2/Decay1/DecayLevel/Decay2/Sustain/Release1/
     ReleaseLevel/Release2 + Curve for Attack/Decay/Release phase
   o added filter as modulation target
   o filter of both SIDs now calibratable, settings stored in internal EEPROM
   o mod matrix + meter display working
   o init patch function implemented (press & hold LINK button)
   o random function implemented (press & hold LINK button)
   o added LFO Rate and Depth as modulation target
   o the sound won't stop anymore if a note is played during the 
     patch is changed/initialized/randomized - instead, the new sound
     will be played
   o support for slave SIDs (access via MBNet)
   o new operations: 1<2, 1>2, 1=2
   o added Volume 1/2 as modulation target
   o Note, LFO and ENV delay implemented
     LFO delay and phase only takes effect when sync flag set (not freerunning)
   o LFO oneshot mode implemented
   o implemented global clock generator
     Since there is no free timer resource, it's realized as a clock
     divider, which is incremented on each update cycle (819.2 uS)
     A clock event will be trigger each time the clock divider value
     has been reached. 
     Div=1 -> event all 1*819.2 uS
     Div=2 -> event all 2*819.2 uS = 1.6 mS
     Div=3 -> event all 3*819.2 uS = 2.5 mS
     etc...
   o optionally the clock generator can be used as MIDI clock receiver
     (Mod: Slv) - the MIDI clock can be divided as well
     Div=3  -> event all 32th notes
     Div=6  -> event all 16th notes
     Div=12 -> event all 8th notes
     Div=24 -> event all 4th notes
     etc...
   o "Mod: Auto" not implemented yet - should switch automatically to
     slave mode when a MIDI clock is received
   o implementation of Arpeggiator has started
     it is located in a separate menu now
     each voice has its own arpeggiator with own parameter sets (!)
     it's clocked by the global clock generator
     Spd divides the global clock again
     GLn (Gatelength) defines, at which clock between 1 and Spd the
       gate will be released
     Rng defines the octave range
   o Arp: added Up/Down/U&D/D&U/UD2/DU2/Random direction
   o Arp: added Sorted mode
   o Arp: added Hold mode
   o Arp: added "sync divider" mode
     - if disabled, the clock divider will be reset with a new chord, so
       that the arp starts immediately - perfect for live playing
     - if enabled, the clock divider won't be reset, so that it is always
       in synch with the global clock generator - perfect for MIDI slave mode
   o "Constant Arp Cycle" implemented
   o Velocity, Aftertouch, PitchBend, Keynumber, Knob #1-5 now
     available as modulation source
   o Knobs controllable via CC
     - Knob #1 assigned to CC#1 (ModWheel)
     - Knob #2-5 assigned to CC#16-19
   o Modulation parameters for Knobs (and Velocity=K#V,
     Aftertouch=K#A, PitchBender=K#P) are set within the Min/Max
     boundaries, which can now be edited in the new KNB menu page
     Note that sweeps from -128..127 and 127..-128 (swapped) are
     provided
   o Knob#1-Knob#5 now controllable directly from the CS Step C
     with the 5 rotary encoders of the oscillator section (select
     "Assign" layer)
   o removed "Balance" parameter, as it is redundant
     Can be realized with:
     MOD SRC1:K#1 In1:*, In2:o, Dep:127, Vol: L/R
   o support for AOUT/AOUT_LC
     - offset values (12 bit, 000-FFF) can be configured in new EXT menu
   o note: EXT (external) could also be read as "extension", because it
     the 12bit values could also be used for different purposes ("custom
     values")
   o implementation of trigger matrix
     It consist of 16 sources and 24 targets
     Sources are:
       Note On, Note Off, ENV1/2 Decay Phase, ENV1/2 Sustain Phase,
       LFO1-6 Period, Clock, Clock/4, Clock/16, MIDI Start
     Targets are:
       OSC1-3 L/R Gate (6 targets), ENV1/2 Attack, ENV1/2 Release,
       LFO1-6 Restart, Wavetable 1-4 Reset, Wavetable 1-4 Step
   o Trigger matrix connections can be configured in new TRG menu
   o Note that old patches have to be adapted the following way:
       - Note On: all 6 gates and ENV1/2 attack phase have to be assigned
       - Note Off: all 6 gates and ENV1/2 release phase have to be assigned
       - MIDI Start: ENV1/2 Attack and LFO 1-6 have to be assigned
       - the formerly LFO sync flag has now a new location in the trigger
         matrix. It has to be assigned in the Note On source. This can
         also be done from the LFO menu (shortcut for this TRG matrix connection)
   o Example 1 - LFO Chain:
     Assign all LFOs to OSC Pitch
     All LFOs in Oneshot Mode
     Use different LFO rates and depths
     Enable following Trigger connections:
        Note On->L1
        L1P -> L2
        L2P -> L3
        L3P -> L4
        L4P -> L5
        L5P -> L6
        L6P -> L1
   o Example 2 - ENV Retrigger via LFO1:
     Assign ENV1 to OSC Pitch
     Disable the Note On -> E1A connection
     Enable the LFO1 -> E1A connection
     Try different LFO1 rates and ENV A/D/S rates
   o Example 3 - Note Retrigger via LFO1:
     Enable the LFO1 -> O1L and O1R connection
     Try different LFO1 rates
     Try different OSC ADSR values (e.g. A=8, D=5, S=0, R=0) - remind the ADSR bug! :-/
     Try also different Delays between Left and Right SID
   o Example 4 - Simple ENV loop:
     Enable the E1S -> E1A connection
     Now ENV1 will loop between the attack and sustain phase
  o new button functions:
      - Link button now controls SHIFT function (and displays CFG page)
      - CC button now used as Page Up function (increments OSC/LFO/ENV/MOD/TRG/KNB depending on menu)
      - Edit button now used as Page Down function (increments OSC/LFO/ENV/MOD/TRG/KNB depending on menu)
      - Page Up/Down + datawheel (main encoder) allows to change the page via encoder
      - CC can be activated by pressing SHIFT+CC
      - Edit can be activated by pressing SHIFT+EDIT
      - SHIFT+E1/E2/L1..L6 button branches to the Envelope/LFO menu
  o SHIFT button now increases the speed of rotary encoders
  o added phase offset synchronisation feature
    Phases of the oscillators can be shifted in 0.4% steps!
    There is only one global phase available, which can be configured
    in the OSC menu. If != 0, the value specifies the phase offset
    between OSC1->OSC2 and OSC2->OSC3
  o added F2A (Filter to AOUT) function which allows to forward
    CutOff/Resonance to 4 AOUT channels (assignments are defined in setup_*.asm)
  o implemented knob parameters:
    - list of parameters can be found in mbsidv2_parameter_chart.txt
    - note that some parameters are not really suitable for live
      control - the table has been prepared for the WT handler, which
      will use the same parameter set
    - two different parameters can be assigned to a knob
    - the LCD shows the parameter in long format when the assignment is changed
      (selecting the item with a button does not already show the long format.
       I tried this, but the behaviour was too confusing... - you need to move
       the encoder to see the purpose of the value)
    - the handler automatically scales the knob value to the range of the
      target parameter. Regardless if a 4bit or a 12bit value should be controlled,
      the whole knob range from 0..255 will always be used
    - in addition, the knob range can be scaled a second time from a
      min to a max value
    - The formula:
         resulting parameter value = scale1(scale2(knob value))
      where scale2() scales over the specified min/max range
      and scale1() scales over the parameter range
    - Sounds confusing? Try this: Min=104, Max=152, Pa1=36 (Transpose OSC123)
      This will modify the 7bit value transpose from -12 to +12 notes
      (*2 because it's transposed from a 8bit value)
      Resp.: 128 +/- (2*12)
    - note that knob changes are non-destructive!
      This means: changing a parameter will not change the original value. 
      Accordingly the value visible in the CS menu will stay the same.
      This is especially required to ensure, that changes made with knobs
      are really temporary and won't be stored with the "patch save" function.
    - OSC/Filter parameter changes are always applied on both SID channels. 
      Offset calculations are done separately
    - TODO: "reset original value" function, accessible from the CFG menu,
      to remove the offsets from the original parameter values
  o implemented wavetable handler:
    - there is a WTC (Wavetable Configuration) and a separate WTE
     (Wavetable Edit) menu for easier navigation
    - it is possible to jump from WTC to WTE and back (last menu item)
    - WTC provides four different wavesets. 
      You can specify a parameter, SID L/R, Speed (Clock Divider for
      clock events coming from the trigger matrix),
      begin, end and loop position (with optional oneshot mode) within wavetable
    - WTE allows to edit the wavetable like known from MBSID V1
      Even Notes and ARPs can be played :)
    - WTE value display can be changed between Hex/Dec view
    - wavetable values are forwarded to MOD matrix as additional sources
    - the wavetable pointer can be optionally controlled from the
      modulation matrix. For this, the "MOD" flag has to be set in
      the WTC menu. In this mode, the clock divider and loop pointer
      don't play a role anymore. WT1-WT4 are available as modulation
      target, the pointer is swept between the begin and end range.
      Try to control the position with a LFO or an Envelope or the 
      velocity, and have fun! :)
  o there is now a new random generator menu which allows to randomize
    different sections of a patch separately
  o LFOs and ENVs can now be synchronized to the global clock (CSn flag)
    This clock is quadrubled to achieve better resolutions when it is
    synchronized to MIDI
    With Div=3, the LFO/ENV will be clocked 4 times for each 32th note,
    8 times for each 16th, 128 times for each measure...
    
    There are predefined rates for MIDI clock synchronisation, which
    can be selected in the LFO page when CSn is enabled
    They are starting at rate=245:
    64/1, 32/1, 16/1, 8/1, 4/1, 2/1, 1/1, 3/4, 1/2, 1/4, 1/16

  o BankStick support
    a 64k BS can store 127 patches, a 32k BS only 63 patches
    The BS size will be detected automatically during formatting
  o a "detune" parameter has been added to the CFG menu. It
    modifies the finetune of all oscillators
  o added GAE (gate always active) function - once set, the gate
    will never be released anymore. Instead, the voice volume has
    to be lowered externally or with a filter
  o added ABW (ADSR bug workaround) flag
    It adds an additional delay before the gate is activated.
    During this time, the ADSR registers are zeroed to ensure that
    the envelope has reached its final level before it will be
    triggered again.
    If you still notice ADSR hickups with a special configuration,
    just increase the ADSR delay in the OSC menu
    Note that the delay needs to be compensated from your sequencer.
    This feature is experimental and not suitable for live playing
  o the Env Ctrl button doesn't change the menu anymore
    so that the 5 rotary encoders of the ENV section can be used to
    change the currently visible menu items on a more confortable way
  o added V2A (Volume to AOUT) function which allows to forward
    the modulated volumes to 2 AOUT channels (assignments are defined in setup_*.asm)
    The internal volume is set to maximum if the V2A switch is enabled
  o added ARP oneshot mode
  o pitch (controlled by pitchbender) got a special parameter number: 80 dec, 0x50 hex
  o slave cloning function implemented
    press and hold the MENU button during boot to transfer the firmware 
    of the master to all slaves via the CAN interface
    This procedure takes ca. 30 seconds, some messages will be print
    on screen (if not, something is wrong with the MENU button detection -
    please inform me in this case)
  o preparation for multiple engines: separated SID_SE and CS_MENU_TABLE parts
  o started with multi engine
  o implemented ensemble functions, so that different channels and
    keyboard splitzones can be assigned to multi channel instruments
    an ensemble contains for each master/slave MBSID:
    - Bank/Pattern/Flags (like V2A, F2A)
    - Global Clock Generator settings
    - Filter calibration values (Min/Max) for left/right channel
    - the setup for 6 instruments (channel, splitzone, transpose)
  o the new ensemble menu page can be entered from the main menu:
    - press the leftmost select button below the LCD to enter ensemble menu
    - press any other select button below the LCD to enter the patch menu
  o up to 128 ensembles can be stored in a BankStick (only 32k allocated,
    so it doesn't matter if a 32k or 64k BankStick is used)
  o first beta release :)
  o there is now a S&H (Sample & Hold) operator available in the
    modmatrix which samples SRC1 whenever SRC2 changes from a negative
    to a positive value
  o an incoming patch or bank change request doesn't update the 
    the patch anymore if it was already selected before. This is to avoid
    "glitches" when a sequencer sends a program change shortly before
    a note is played.
  o the "Knobs" are sending CC values now when the CC function is
    activated (press SHIFT + Page Up/CC Button to toggle this mode)
    Other parameters are still not sending CCs over MIDI, as NRPNs
    are not implemented yet (low priority)
    The CC numbers are 1 for Knob #1 (Modulation wheel), and 16/17/18/19
    for Knob #2-#5 (GP values)
    In addition, Knob #P sends Pitchwheel Events in CC mode
  o support for analog inputs (J5:A0..A4)
    This feature has to be enabled in the setup_*.asm file by setting DEFAULT_J5_FUNCTION to 1
    Conversion results of the analog inputs are directly passed to the knob handler. 
    This generic approach has the advantage, that it is possible to control 5*2 parameters 
    within a specified Min/Max range, and that in addition the analog values are available
    as modulation source within the modulation matrix (K#1..K#5)

    The feature behaves differently on master and slaves:
    Master: analog inputs are forwarded to the selected SIDs - use this
            option as replacement for rotary encoders, or for adding
            analog control elements like pots/faders/joysticks to your CS
    Slave: analog inputs are only handled internally - use this option
           for modulation with analog signal generators
  o added "Notes Off" function to the SHIFT page (replaces Random
    function which has a separate menu page anyhow)
  o implemented bassline engine
  o support for AOUT_NG module
  o integrated support for ASID protocol, which has been originally
    developed for the SIDstation to replay .sid files.
    (see also http://www.midibox.org/forum/index.php?topic=2038.0)
    Only the master core (Device ID 00) will play SID tunes!
    Nice visual effect: the LED matrix of the CS shows three animated 
    meters whenever a gate flag of an oscillator is set.
    SID player mode is automatically enabled once an ASID stream is
    received. It can be exit by stopping the player on the PC, and 
    pressing the MENU button

    Unfortunately it turned out, that there is currently no SID player
    available which can replay .sid files properly via MIDI.

    - SIDplay (http://www.d.kth.se/~d93-alo/c64/spw/sidplayw.html)
      Perfect integration, but plays tunes too fast under WinXP.
      Works fine under Win95/Win98/WinME. Not tested under Vista
    - ASID (http://www.sidstation.com/sidsupport.php)
      Crashes under WinXP once the tune should be played
    - ASID XP (http://www.sidstation.com/files/asid_xp_1.0.zip)
      Tunes played correctly, but the MIDI stream is corrupted at 
      the very beginning when the player is started. Accordingly the
      sounds are not properly initialized.

    Workaround: start a tune with SIDplay (for proper sound
    initialisation), thereafter play it with ASID XP
  o resonance now editable with 8bit resolution (only applicable for F2A option)
  o implemented global BPM generator, which replaces the global clock divider
    for more consistent clock handling
    Now it doesn't make a difference anymore, if MBSID receives a 
    clock at a certain BPM, or if it generates it internally
  o support for sustain CC#64 (if CC value >= 0x40, notes will be
    held, with CC value < 0x40, notes will be released)
    Currently only supported for lead engine!
  o drum engine implemented
  o meter mode now also supported for multi/bassline/drum engine
  o superpoly function implemented for lead engine (experimental!)
  o various improvements for drum sequence editing:
    - cursor now controlled with encoder
    - the "<" function has been replaced by a rotate function, which
      allows you to scroll the pattern left/right
    - the ">" function has been replaced by a direct shortcut to
      the DRM menu page - the instrument number will be set 
      automatically according to the selected track
    - the mod target buttons (named with E1/E2/L1/...L6) now 
      change to the track editor, and select the appr. track (1-8)
  o implemented MIDI Clock Master/Slave Auto Detection
  o bassline/drum sequences now stopped when a MIDI Clock Stop
    event has been received
  o bassline/drum sequences now started when a MIDI Clock Start or
    Continue event has been received
  o improved "play button" function (e.g. only selected instruments
    played, selected drum is triggered, etc...)
  o support for "Sync" button (it just jumps into the ENS->CLK
    menu for Master/Slave/Auto mode and BPM selection)
  o support for full parameter access via NRPNs
    see mbsidv2_parameter_chart.txt for details
  o possibilities to select a patch:
      - moving datawheel in main screen (as before)
      - using Page Up/Down button in main screen and patch main menu
      - selecting bank and patch in the ENS->SID menu
  o possibilities to select an ensemble:
      - pressing MENU + moving datawheel in main screen
      - using MENU + Page Up/Down button in main screen
      - using Page Up/Down button in ENS menu
  o ensemble can now be initialised with preset (-> go into ENS
    menu, press SHIFT button, select "Ini.Ens" option)
    Note that Patch and Bank settings won't be touched by
    this initialisation!
  o there is now a new EXT page within the ensemble menu which
    contains following options:
       - F2A (Filter-to-Analog): was previously located in SID menu
       - V2A (Volume-to-Analog): was previously located in SID menu
       - Iv1..Iv8: inversion of output voltage at channel #1..#8
  o added optional FIP option (Filter Interpolation) which smoothes
    CutOff changes. It is especially useful when CutOff is changed
    via CC (-> low resolution) to reduce the steppyness.
    The option is not useful when the CutOff parameter is modulated from
    a fast LFO or envelope (on the other hand: it produces interesting
    effects in such cases ;-)

RC13:
  o multi engine: improved approach for routing LFOs to filters (only
    LFO of last assigned voice will be used for more predictable results)
  o reduced intensity of LFO pitch modulation for multi and bassline engine
    (Lead engine: intensity can be reduced by decreasing the depth
    of the modulation path)
  o 8 external switches can now be connected to 
     - DOUT shift register (-> DEFAULT_EXT_SWITCH_DOUT != 0)
     - port J5 of the core mode (-> DEFAULT_J5_FUNCTION == 3)
    The switch states are stored in the patch structure, and
    can be accessed via Control Surface (EXT menu) or via Parameter Change
    (NRPNs/Knobs/Wavetables)
  o support for dumping ensembles via SysEx
  o the SysEx structures are now completely documented under
    doc/mbsidv2_sysex_implementation.txt

RC14:
  o BankStick write via SysEx now gracefully aborted if only 32k BankStick
    is addressed and patch number >= 065
    SysEx error number 0x11 ("BankStick too small") will be returned in this case
  o the "send dump" function of the "shift menu" now sends the edit buffer
    of the selected SID, which also includes the corresponding device ID.
    BankStick content won't be overwritten if such a dump is sent back.
  o menu page automatically changed to the previous selection if SID master
    or slave selected which is running with a different engine

RC15:
  o improved FIP function (linear interpolation of filter cutoff) - it
    is working now the same way as implemented in MIDIbox CV
  o F2A and V2A flags moved to new storage position in ensemble - old
    ensemble setups (where F2A and/or V2A was set) have to be adapted!
  o added new AOUT forwarding functions:
     - P2A (Pulsewidth-to-AOUT)
     - K2A (Key-to-AOUT)
     - O2A (Oscillator Frequency-to-AOUT)
    Channel assignments have to be adapted in setup_*.asm - all channels 
    are disabled by default
  o added functions to forward the 6 gates/slide/accent signals to the
    digital outputs at J5. Assignments have to be configured in the
    setup_*.asm file.
    Note that DEFAULT_J5_FUNCTION has to be set to 3 in order to
    enable the digital output function of CORE:J5

RC16:
  o "ENV Misc" layer added for MB6582 Control Surface
  o SIDPlayer: lower line now always cleared when new LCD message
    is sent by host
  o changed encoder speed behaviour: values incremented fast by
    default now. Incrementer is slowed down by pressing the SHIFT button
    (previously it was the opposite behaviour)

RC17:
  o switched from MPASM to gpasm
    code now under version control (SVN)

RC18:
  o modulation matrix: comparison operators >, < and = now return 0 instead
    of full negative value if comparison is false
  o changed SusKey handling, so that it also works in Mono mode (previously
    it was only working in Legato mode)
  o SusKey and Legato flags now accessible in Bassline CFG menu
  o Individual Attack/Decay/Release Curve assignments now accessible in
    Multi/Bassline ENV menu
  o Trigger Matrix: since the BPM clock generator concept has been changed in
    one of the previous releases, we now have a Clk/6 and Clk/24 trigger instead
    of Clk/4 and Clk/16
  o LFO and ENV MIDI sync working properly again
  o portamento omitted after patch change when first key is played

RC19:
  o Enhancements for SysEx Editor
    (see also doc/mbsidv2_sysex_implementation.txt)
    - introduced <WOPT> function which allows to change parameters of
      multiple voices with a single SysEx command
    - introduced <sids> selection which allows to access slave SIDs
      via master SID (command 0C 00 <sids>)
    - added SysEx command for all notes/sequences off (command 0C 08)
    - added SysEx command to play the current patch (command 0C 09 [<ins>])
      Note: for proper handling of <ins>, separate keyboard zones or MIDI channels
      for multi instruments are currently required - this is no bug, 
      but just an imperfection (I was too lazy to overwork SID_PATCH_NotesOn yet)
  o parameter assignment/patch/bank selection: "big message" now displayed
    immediately when menu item has been selected
  o The "note off" function of the SHIFT menu now works as "Note On/Off" (called "Ply")
    This function is intended as replacement for the optional Play button
    Patch will be played/stopped on all selected SIDs
  o Removed button combination "SIDx+MENU" (which was previously used for Play function)
    This combination could get a different purpose on future
  o LFOs and ENVs of right channel bassline working properly again
  o AOUT_LC driver now supports 12/12/8 resolution (requires 4 combined 74HC595)

RC20:
  o Multi Engine: arp handler working properly again
  o Lead Engine: ENV encoder section working properly again
  o increased startup delay, so that slave cores will be found even if no BankStick connected

RC21:
  o added "Log" flag to ENS->FIL menu: cutoff frequency converted through log function
    to achieve better linearisation of 8580 filter
  o Filter Keytracking parameter now also available for Lead Engine, the scaling has been slightly
    changed, so that the maximum value 255 leads to 1:1 tracking (e.g. if 8580 Log function activated,
    or an external filter is connected)
  o added "DOR" flag to the ENS->SID menu: Disable automatic Oscillator Reset during patch change
    could also be called DAORDPC flag ;-)
  o MB-6582 setup: swapped page up/down button, added Inc/Dec button function
  o support for 4x20 LCD has used for MB-6582: DEFAULT_LCD_LINES and DEFAULT_LCD_LINE_Y* can
    be configured in the setup_*.asm file
  o MB-6582 screen now centered at 2nd and 3rd line
  o if DEFAULT_LCD_LINES >= 3, the name of the menu will be print at the upper line
  o if DEFAULT_LCD_LINES >= 4: the value of the currently edited parameter will be displayed
    as horizontal bar graph at the lower LCD line
    TODO: display bidirectional parameters like "depth" with a left/right splitted graph
    TODO: update when a new OSC/Channel/SID is selected
  o the "blinking LCD cursor" which was set to the selected parameter position is
    disabled by default now (DEFAULT_LCD_PRINT_CURSOR set to 0), since it clashes with
    the horizontal bar graph output routine
  o added experimental features to bassline engine:
    - new menu page O23 which allows to use OSC2 and OSC3 as slave oscillators
    - waveforms of slave oscillators can be selected separately
    - individual sync and ringmod flags
    - individual octavewise transpose
    - individual pulsewidth
    - optional static note (decoupled from master osc) for nice sync/ringmod effects or chords
    - phase offset
    - detune
    - TODO: Knob assignments and maybe more functions

RC22:
  o "menu labels" (activated if DEFAULT_LCD_LINES >= 3) now completely implemented
  o added keyboard transpose function for bassline sequencer. MIDI channels and
    keyboard zones have to be configured for L/R bassline separately with
    ensemble instrument 3 and 4. The transposer uses C-3 as base note.
    Example configuration:
    Ins1 Chn 1 SpL C-3 SpU B-3 Trn 0     L Bassline sequence selected with key C-3..B-3
    Ins2 Chn 1 SpL C-4 SpU G-8 Trn 0     R Bassline sequence selected with key C-4..
    Ins3 Chn 1 SpL c-2 SpU B-2 Trn +12   L Bassline sequence transposed with lower keys until B-2
    Ins4 Chn 1 SpL c-2 SpU B-2 Trn +12   R same as for L
    "Trn +12" is required in this setup to compensate the octave range of the transposer
    (base note C-3 is outside the selected keyboard zone c-2..B-2)
  o bassline and drum sequences not stopped anymore on patch changes
  o random generator for bassline O23 settings

RC23:
  o finetune is working properly again

RC24:
  o voice allocation of multi engine working again
  o Lead engine: MdW (ModWheel) and Key modulation source now provide a value in
    positive range only
  o overworked oscillator pitch handling: now completely linear frequency
    calculations. 
    Advantages:
      - modulation frequency (e.g. LFO vibrato) independent from oscillator frequency
      - accurate filter key tracking
      - the O2A option (forward pitch to AOUT) doesn't result into out-of-scale
        SID frequencies anymore
  o the presets under presets/v2_vintage_bank.syx have been overworked according to
    the new osc frequency handling

RC25:
  o improved "SusKey" (fingered portamento) handling

RC26:
  o various improvements for Super Poly Mode and SysEx distribution via CAN


MEMO:
  - in Bassline mode, CCs could control individual knob parameters for
    left/right channel by using the "current" assignment, and selecting
    the instrument (L-, -R or LR) via different sets of CC

  - a solution has to be found for bassline mode, how values changed
    via knobs should be properly forwarded to the edit patch storage
    for consistent value sets
    As this method has advantages and disadvantages (e.g. destructive
    changes in the edit patch are mostly NOT wanted!), maybe a soft-option
    could be provided (but I'm sure, that most people would disable it
    quickly once they noticed the disadvantages)

  - There is currently a "Notes Off" in the Shift menu which allows to
    turn off all notes of the selected SID(s)
    For more comfort, it could make sense to send this command too all
    SIDs independent from the SID selection
    In addition, a "Note On" (Play) command could also be placed into
    the Shift menu - but where? (maybe as replacement for Init Patch,
    as a patch can also be initialized by changing the engine)

  - drum engine mode: additional parameter for WT table offset?

  - individual copy/paste/clr function for drum instruments?

  - individual save function for instruments (for all engines)

  - selection of bank/patch within same screen in ENS->SID->Bnk/Pat page

  - if multiple SIDs with different engines are connected, the
    performed CS modifications (button/encoder turns) can result into
    a big mess. A fix isn't so easy (easiest but inconsistent solution: the
    master has to remember the engines of SID1..4 in order to decide,
    if a parameter is allowed for beeing sent)

  - theoretically it could be possible to modulate 8 of 256 sound
    parameters (which are normaly only accessible via knobs, WT or NRPN)
    from the modulation pathes (e.g. envelope or LFO source) by providing
    a special EXT -> Par (AOUT Value -> Sound Parameter) routing.
    Since 8 EXT values are available with 12bit resolution, this should
    be sufficient for most cases.
    The AOUT option wouldn't be available in such a mode...

  - the external switches could be optionally triggered by notes, or
    maybe better: reflect the gate of ENV1 and/or ENV2 which is used to switch
    between attack/decay/sustain and release phase
    This would be a quite useful function for external ADSR generators
    Problem: which possibilities are really required, how should it
    behave for the different engines, how should it be configured? Within ensemble?

  - a switch which disables the menu jumping when an encoder has been moved
    has been requested from multiple users meanwhile

  - a switch which swaps the encoder speed selection: slow by default, fast
    if SHIFT button pressed
